I have obfuscated the Intro to Data Analysis with Data Analysis. The aim of Intro to Data Analysis is to introduce tools that is useful in Data Analysis. I am a MATLAB hobbyist, so I finish some programs of the class with MATLAB. However, this is stupid because it makes this class useless. I will leave this class for a while. When I really want these tools, I will be back.
I also fix some problem of teacher's code with Python 3.
Just feel free to use them.
Good Luck!
